# Electrum starter kit v3

To get up and running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Wait for WebpackDevServer to display a message like this:

```
WebpackDevServer listening at http://localhost:3000
15:55:21: hot rebuild; successful âˆš
```

then point your browser to http://localhost:3000/ and marvel at the beauty of
Electrum-wrapped React components.
